.SH NAME
eval \- Evaluate a Tcl script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeval \fIarg \fR?\fIarg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBEval\fR takes one or more arguments, which together comprise a Tcl
script containing one or more commands.
\fBEval\fR concatenates all its arguments in the same
fashion as the \fBconcat\fR command, passes the concatenated string to the
Tcl interpreter recursively, and returns the result of that
evaluation (or any error generated by it).
Note that the \fBlist\fR command quotes sequences of words in such a
way that they are not further expanded by the \fBeval\fR command.

.SH KEYWORDS
concatenate, evaluate, script

.SH "SEE ALSO"
catch(n), concat(n), error(n), list(n), subst(n), tclvars(n)
