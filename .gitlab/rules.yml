# Rules for where jobs can run

###
## Job variables:
##   PV_CI_RUN_MANUALLY
##     Set to "true" if the job should be manually triggered in MRs. These jobs
##     will also be delayed for branch update pipelines
##   PV_CI_MERGED_ONLY
##     Set to "true" to make the job only run for merged pipelines.
##   PV_CI_NIGHTLY_ONLY
##     Set to "true" if the job should only run for nightly pipelines.
