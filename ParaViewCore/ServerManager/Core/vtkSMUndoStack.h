/**
 * @class   vtkSMUndoStack
 *
 * This is the undo/redo stack for the Server Manager. This provides a
 * unified face for undo/redo irrespective of number of connections, their
 * type etc etc.
 *
 * On every undo/redo, it fetches the XML state change from the server.
 * vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader is used to generate a vtkUndoSet object from
 * the XML. GUI can subclass vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader to handle GUI specific
 * XML elements. The loader instance must be set before performing the undo,
 * otherwise vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader is used.
 *
 * This class also provides API to push any vtkUndoSet instance on to a
 * server. GUI can use this to push its own changes that is undoable across
 * connections.
