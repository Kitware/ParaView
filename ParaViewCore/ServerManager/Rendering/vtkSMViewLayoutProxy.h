/**
 * @class   vtkSMViewLayoutProxy
 * @brief   vtkSMViewLayoutProxy is used by ParaView to layout
 * multiple views in a 2D KD-Tree layout.
 *
 *
 * vtkSMViewLayoutProxy is used by ParaView to layout multiple views in a 2D
 * KD-Tree layout. This is proxy, hence can be registered with the proxy manager
 * just like other regular proxies; participates in xml state saving/restoring,
 * undo-redo, etc. Users can affects the GUI layout using this proxy instance
 * from Python as well.
 *
 * Every time the vtkSMViewLayoutProxy changes so that it would affect the UI,
 * this class fires vtkCommand::ConfigureEvent.
 *
 * View proxies that are to laid out in an layout should be "assigned" to a
 * particular cell in a vtkSMViewLayoutProxy instance. vtkSMViewLayoutProxy
 * takes over the responsibility of updating the view's \c Position property
 * correctly.
 *
 * Although, currently, there are no safe guards against assigning a view to
 * more than one layout, this is strictly prohibited and can cause unexpected
 * problems at run-time.
