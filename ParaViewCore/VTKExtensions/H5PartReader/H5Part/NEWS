Error Handling
--------------
 Now all functions, in which an error could occure, are returning a
value. This value is either a 64bit integer or a pointer.

 A negative 64bit integer as result indicates an error. Values >= 0
indicates successfull execution.   This is similiar to the convention
used in UNIX system calls, but we do not return -1 but the error
number (which is always negative).

 For functions returning a pointer the NULL-pointer is used to indicate
an error. You can call the function H5PartGetErrno() to get the error
number.  For the time being there is no strerror(3) or perror(3)
equivalent.


API Changes
-----------
 There are several changes in the API of H5Part. The biggest change is
a side-effect of the implementation of strict error handling.  The
impact to the existing C/C++ code is very small.  But now you *can*
and *should* implement some kind of error handling.  The simplest
error handling is to set an error handler which aborts the program as
soon as an error occured.

 The next "biggest" change is the use of H5Part types instead of "long
long" and "double". The replacement of "long long" is "h5part_int64_t"
and for "double" "h5part_float64_t". This change has now effect in
Fortran.

 In some functions the argument type changed from "int" to
"h5part_int64_t". Since on most systems "int" is a 32bit integer,
calls to these functions must be adapted to the new API. In C/C++ the
compiler will complain about it. But in Fortran you will *not* get an
error message.So, you must check your Fortran code carefully.

 Changes in detail (not listed are functions where only the return
type changed from any to "h5part_int64_t"):
