/**
 * @class   vtkPVView
 * @brief   baseclass for all ParaView views.
 *
 * vtkPVView adds API to vtkView for ParaView specific views. Typically, one
 * writes a simple vtkView subclass for their custom view. Then one subclasses
 * vtkPVView to use their own vtkView subclass with added support for
 * parallel rendering, tile-displays and client-server. Even if the view is
 * client-only view, it needs to address these other configuration gracefully.
