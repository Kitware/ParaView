Introduction
============
[ParaView][] is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and

The first public release was announced in October 2002. Since then, the project
has grown through collaborative efforts between [Kitware Inc.][Kitware],
[Sandia National Laboratories][Sandia],
[Los Alamos National Laboratory][LANL],
[Army Research Laboratory][ARL], and various other
government and commercial institutions, and academic partners.

You can install it via:

```


Building
========

There are two ways to build ParaView:

* The easiest method for begginners to build ParaView from source is
by using our [Getting Started compilation guide][build] which includes
commands to install the needed dependencies for most operating systems.

* Another way to build ParaView, quite useful when trying to enable more specific
options which requires to build dependencies yourself (ie osmesa, raytracing),
would be the [ParaView Superbuild][sbrepo]. The superbuild downloads and builds all
of ParaView's dependencies as well as ParaView itself.
