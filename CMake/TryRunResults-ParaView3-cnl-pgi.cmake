# This file was generated by CMake because it detected TRY_RUN() commands
# in crosscompiling mode.
# It has been modified to set the correct values when ParaView is compiled
# for Cray Compute Node Linux.
# To use it call cmake and use this file to preload the cache:
# cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<the toolchain file> -C TryRunResults-ParaView3-cnl-pgi.cmake <src dir>

# CMAKE_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT
#    indicates whether the executable would have been able to run on its
#    target platform. If so, set CMAKE_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT to
#    the exit code (in many cases 0 for success), otherwise enter "FAILED_TO_RUN".
# CMAKE_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT__TRYRUN_OUTPUT
#    contains the text the executable would have printed on stdout and stderr.
#    If the executable would not have been able to run, set CMAKE_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT__TRYRUN_OUTPUT empty.
#    Otherwise check if the output is evaluated by the calling CMake code. If so,
#    check what the source file would have printed when called with the given arguments.
# The HAVE_CMAKE_REQUIRE_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT variable holds the build result for this TRY_RUN().
