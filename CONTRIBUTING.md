Contributing to ParaView
========================

Our project uses GitLab for code review and Buildbot to test proposed
patches before they are merged.  Please check our [ParaView Git][]
instructions for details on developing and contributing to the project.

Our [Wiki][] is used to document features, flesh out designs and host other
documentation. We have several [Mailing Lists][] to coordinate development and
to provide support.
