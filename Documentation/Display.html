<h2>View</h2>
The object inspector's Display tab contains user interface elements for
controlling the appearance of the output dataset of the reader, source, or
filter in the selected view (outlined in red). Unlike the behavior of the
controls on the Properties tab, changing the value of a control on the
Display tab are applied immediately: there is no Apply button for the Display
tab.
<p align="center"> <img src="DisplayView.png"/>
</p>
<p>
If the dataset selected in the pipeline browser has never been added to the
selected view, then the Display tab will only contain the View section, and
the only control will be the Visible checkbutton. Once the dataset is visible
in the selected view, several more sections are added to the Display tab, and
the Zoom to Data button is added to the View section. This button centers the
viewing position on the dataset selected from the pipeline browser. This item
will fill most of the selected view unless another dataset is between it and
the viewing position.

<h2>Color</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="DisplayColorSolid.png"/>
</p>
<p>
There are two options available for coloring a dataset. To use the same
color over an entire dataset, select Solid Color from the "Color by"
menu. Clicking the Set Solid Color button below the "Color by" menu displays
a color chooser from which a particular color may be selected. If displaying
a dataset in a solid color, the rest of the controls in the Color section of
the Display tab are inactive.
<p align="center">
<img src="DisplayColorByArray.png"/>
</p>
<p>
If the representation used for displaying the dataset is anything other than
Outline (discussed later on this page), and the dataset contains point- or
cell-centered arrays (attributes), then the "Color by" menu also lists the
names of the arrays. The point-centered arrays are indicated by <img
src="PointData.png" height="10" width="10"/>, and the cell-centered ones are
indicated by <img src="CellData.png" height="10" width="10"/>. Selecting an
array name causes the dataset to be colored based on the underlying values in
that array. In almost all cases, the mapping from data values to colors is
determined by a color map. This color map may be edited from the dialog that
appears from clicking the Editor Color Map button. The only case where colors
may be determined differently is if the data array selected for coloring has
three components and is of type unsigned char. In this case, the three array
values may be directly used as colors if the Map Scalars checkbox is
unchecked. In this case the three components of the array will specify the
red, green, and blue color components. If the Map Scalars checkbox is
checked, the data array is treated the same as any other data array, and
color is determined by passing the data values through a color scale.

<p>
Regardless of how the data values map to colors, interpolation must be done to determine the colors that do not lie at points (nodes) in the dataset. (When coloring by cells (elements), no interpolation is done from one cell to the next; each cell is assigned a solid color.) If the Interpolate Colors checkbutton is checked (the default), the data values are interpolated across cell faces before being mapped to colors. This results in the colors chosen exactly matching those chosen in the color scale editor. However, some older graphics cards do not support this functionality. If the Interpolate Colors checkbox is unchecked, then the interpolation happens in color space. This sometimes results in colors that are not in the specified color map.

<p align="center">
<img src="ColorEditor.png"/>
</p>
<p>
To display the Color Scale Editor dialog, click the Edit Color Map button. At
the top of the Color Scale tab of the Color Scale Editor dialog is a color
map editor. This editor displays the mapping between scalar values and
colors, and provides the means for making modifications to this mapping. The
color scale is shown in the background of the color map editor. The nodes in
the color map editor (shown as colored spheres) indicate the mapping from a
scalar value to a color. The colors are interpolated linearly between the
nodes using the color space chosen in the Color Space menu below the color
map editor. More nodes may be added simply by left-clicking within the
editor. A node in the color map editor becomes selected when it is
left-clicked. The selected node is indicated as a larger sphere in the
editor. Pressing either the 'd' or Delete key removes the selected node from
the editor.
<p>
Clicking the currently selected node or double-clicking any node causes a
color chooser to be displayed, from which a new color may be selected for the
node. The scalar value of the selected node may be interactively changed by
dragging the node either left (decreasing scalar value) or right (increasing
scalar value); the node's color remains the same during this process. The
scalar value for the selected node may also be changed manually by entering a
new value in the Scalar Value entry box. The new scalar value will
automatically take effect after a couple seconds.

<p align="center"> <img
src="ColorScalePresets.png"/>
</p>
<p>
Modifications made to the color map may be saved for future use by clicking
the Save button below the color map editor. This causes the Preset Color
Scales dialog to be displayed, with the current color map added to the list
of presets. Its name is listed as New Color Preset, but the name may be
changed by left-clicking it and typing a new name. Along the right side of
this dialog is a series of buttons. The first two (Import and Export) allow
saving out and loading in of color map presets. This is useful for sharing
color maps with other ParaView users. The next button, Normalize, rescales
the scalar values in the color map so that they lie between 0 and 1; the
values will be scaled to match the scalar range in use when applied to
another dataset. If you do not rescale the scalar values, then the original
scalar values are retained regardless of the scalar range of the
dataset. Whether or not to normalize the scalar range depends on the
application. After the Normalize button is the Remove button. This allows the
user to remove color map presets that are no longer needed. The last button,
Close, closes this dialog and returns to the color scale editor dialog.

<p>
If the array selected in the "Color by" menu has more than one component
(i.e., contains vector data rather than scalar data), ParaView defaults to
mapping from vector magnitude to color. This can be changed using the
Component menu on the Color Scale tab in the Color Scale Editor dialog: the
color may be derived from any component of the vector array or from the
magnitude of the vectors in the array.

<p>
By default in ParaView, the colors in the color map are determined directly
from the values in the chosen data array (either a scalar array or a
component/magnitude of a vector array). If the dataset is being colored based
on a scalar array, there is also the option of deriving the color from the
logarithm (base 10) of the underlying data values. This is done by checking
the Use Logarithmic Scale checkbutton on the Color Scale tab in the Color
Scale Editor dialog. This option is not available when coloring by a
multi-component array.

<p>
ParaView has one color map per given array name. When the array name chosen
for coloring a particular dataset (A) is already being used to color another
dataset (B), ParaView provides the option for whether to rescale the color map
to match the range of the data array in dataset A. This functionality is
provided by the "Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range" checkbox on the
Color Scale tab of the Color Scale Editor dialog. Even if this option is
selected, the "Rescale to Data Range" button below this checkbox is
enabled. This is because automatic rescaling happens when a new dataset is
colored by the same array; the color map does not automatically rescale when
the timestep in a given dataset changes. Clicking the "Rescale to Data Range"
button rescales the color map to match the underlying array, even if only the
timestep changed. This button is also available on the Display tab.

<p>
If the "Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range" checkbox is unchecked, then
the Rescale Range button becomes active. Clicking this button displays a
dialog box for entering the minimum and maximum scalar values that should be
used in the color map. Clicking the Rescale button in this dialog causes the
new minimum and maximum values for the color map to take effect. These
minimum and maximum values will be used regardless of the range of the
underlying data.

<p>
At the bottom of the Color Scale tab in the color scale editor dialog is a
check button (Use Discrete Colors) for specifying whether the color map is
continuous or uses a fixed number of colors. By default a discrete number of
colors (256) are used. When the color map is not continuous, the Resolution
slider is enabled; this specifies the number of colors to use in the color
map. It ranges from 2 to 256. Using discrete colors will map a range of
scalar values to the same color. When using a continuous color map, different
scalar values are assigned different colors.

<p align="center">
<img src="ColorLegend.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The Color Legend tab in the Color Scale Editor dialog controls whether and
how the color legend (showing the mapping from data values to colors) is
shown in the selected view. The Show Color Legend checkbox determines whether
the color legend is visible; this functionality is duplicated on ParaView's
toolbar using the following button: <img src="ColorLegendToolbarButton.png"
width="7" height="11"/>. The Title section contains controls for the
appearance of the title of the color legend: the text used (defaults to the
name of the array from which the colors in the dataset are derived), the
color, font, formatting (bold, italicized, or shadowed), and opacity. The
second text entry box beside the "Text" label is usually used for additional
information about the array being used (e.g., which component of a vector
array is determining colors). Most of the same controls are also available
for the labels showing the data values that map to particular colors. The
exception is that instead of directly entering text, the format of the data
value labels is specified using a format string like the ones accepted by the
printf function. At the bottom of this tab of the Color Scale Editor dialog
is a spinbox for specifying the number of labels (data values) to display
beside the color gradient.

<a name="Style"/>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="DisplayStyle.png"/>
</p>
<p>
From the Representation menu in the style section of the Display tab,
ParaView provides several options for how to display the geometry of the
dataset. The options available regardless of the dataset type are Points,
Wireframe, Surface, and Outline. Volume rendering (discussed later on this
page) is only available for unstructured grid and uniform rectilinear grid
(volume) datasets. Selecting Points displays the vertices of the dataset as
points. The Wireframe option shows all the edges of the cells in the dataset
as lines. If Surface is selected, the faces of the cells making up the
exterior surface of the dataset are shown (and colored as specified in the
"Color by" menu). For most dataset types, if Outline is selected, an
axis-aligned bounding box is drawn, marking the minimum and maximum extents
of the dataset in each dimension. If the dataset is curvilinear, then the
outside edges of the dataset are drawn instead of an axis-aligned bounding
box. Structured grids, rectilinear grids, and uniform rectilinear grids
(images/volumes) default to being drawn using a Wireframe representation. All
other dataset types default to being drawn as surfaces.

<p>
When the dataset is displayed as a surface, the Interpolation menu in this
section determines how shading (lighting effects) is applied to the
dataset. If Flat is selected, each polygon in the surface will have a single
intensity value, but different polygons will have different intensities,
making the surface look faceted. If instead Gouraud is chosen (the default),
and the dataset has point-centered normal vectors, then the intensity values
will be interpolated across each polygon, giving a smoother
appearance. (Gouraud shading has no effect without point-centered normals,
but the <a href="PolyDataNormals.html">Normals Generation</a> filter can be
used to add them.)

<p>
If the geometric representation of the dataset contains points (vertices),
use the "Point size" spinbox to specify how large the points should
appear. The value of the spinbox indicates the number of pixels in the
horizontal and vertical directions each point should use. If the dataset
contains lines, the "Line width" spinbox indicates (in pixels) the width of
the lines. The default point size is 5 pixels, and the default line width is
1 pixel.

<p>
For datasets represented as geometry (i.e., not volume rendered), the Opacity
spinbox determines how opaque/transparent the geometry is. (For volume
rendered datasets, this spinbox has no effect.) The opacity value ranges
between 0 and 1. An opacity of 1 (the default) means the dataset is
completely opaque. An opacity of 0 means the dataset is completely
transparent.

<p align="center">
<img src="ColorOpacityEditor.png"/>
</p>
<p>
ParaView supports volume rendering of unstructured grid and uniform
rectilinear grid (volume) datasets. For datasets of these types, a Volume
option is added to the Representation menu. By clicking on the Edit Color Map
button (in the Color section), the above dialog box is displayed. The dialog
is the same as the one displayed for specifying a color map for geometry
rendered as a surface except that the color map editor at the top of the
Color Scale tab in the dialog can be used to edit both color and
opacity. Both of these values are specified per node in the color map
editor. The color is indicated and chosen as it was for editing color
alone. The opacity at a given node (scalar value) is indicated by its
position along the Y-axis (height). The bottom of the Y-axis maps to an
opacity value of 0 (completely transparent), and the Y-axis maps to an
opacity value of 1 (completely opaque). The opacity of a node may be changed
by clicking and dragging a node in the vertical direction. The opacity for
the currently selected node may also be modified by entering a value in the
Opacity text entry box. Values entered here will take effect after a couple
seconds.

<a name="Transformation"/>
<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="DisplayTransformation.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The Transformation section of the Display tab provides spinboxes for
performing affine transformations on the associated dataset. Positioning the
dataset in the view using these controls does not change the internal
coordinates of the dataset. The Translate controls reposition the dataset
along the X, Y, and Z axes. The Scale controls increase or decrease the 3D
size of the dataset in each of the three dimensions. The Orientation controls
rotate the dataset in X, Y, or Z by the specified number of degrees. This
rotation happens around the coordinate specified by the Origin spinboxes.
