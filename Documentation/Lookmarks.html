Lookmarks get their name for representing visual bookmarks of data. They 
encapsulate the state of the filters, displays, and rendering parameters 
required to restore a particular view of one or more datasets. They are 
useful if you find yourself repeatedly performing the same set of operations 
on your data before beginning analysis. Also, as you are analyzing data, 
they allow you to save areas and views of interest that you might like to 
return to later.

<h2>Creating a Lookmark</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="CreateLookmarkDialog.png"/>
</p>
<p>
A lookmark may be created in one of two ways. Selecting "Create Lookmark"
from the Tools menu will create a lookmark of the active view (highlighted in
red), while pressing the lookmark button <img src="pqLookmark16.png"/> in the upper 
right corner of a render view will create a lookmark of that view. In either 
case, the user must then enter a (unique) name for the lookmark in the dialog 
box that appears and can (optionally) add a text description that will be 
stored with the lookmark. Clicking the Create button will store a copy of the
lookmark. Lookmarks created in one ParaView session are available in
subsequent ParaView sessions unless they are deleted. (Accessing stored
lookmarks and deleting existing lookmarks are discussed later on in this page.)

<h2>Accessing Lookmarks</h2>
<h3>Lookmark Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to access lookmarks is through the lookmark toolbar.  It is 
located on the right side of the ParaView application window by default and 
is visible when lookmarks have been created. It contains an icon for each 
lookmark. Hovering your mouse over an icon in the toolbar will display the 
lookmark's name in a help balloon, while right-clicking an icon will give the 
user the option to delete that lookmark, edit its properties (by displaying the 
Lookmark Inspector), create a new lookmark (by displaying the "Create Lookmark" 
dialog), or display the Lookmark Browser. Left-clicking on an icon in the 
lookmark toolbar will apply that lookmark to the current source in the active 
view.

<h3>Lookmark Browser</h3>
<p align="center">
<img src="LookmarkBrowser.png"/>
</p>
<p>
The Lookmark Browser is available from the right-click menu in the lookmark
toolbar and from the View menu. It contains a list of all lookmarks available
in the current ParaView session. Using the buttons at the top of the browser 
you may: export the selected lookmarks to a file, import lookmarks from a file 
to be added to the end of the browser, or delete the selected lookmarks. The 
"Ctrl" and "Shift" keys can be used in conjunction with the left mouse-button 
to select multiple items in the browser. Double-clicking an item will apply 
that lookmark to the selected view. Finally, if the Lookmark Inspector (see 
next section) is open at the same time as the Lookmark Browser, the inspector 
will display the properties of the currently selected lookmark in the browser.

<h3>Lookmark Inspector</h3>
<p align="center">
<img src="LookmarkInspector.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The Lookmark Inspector (View menu, Lookmark Inspector) displays the
properties of a lookmark. The lookmark that it displays is changed by either
selecting a new item in the Lookmark Browser or by choosing "Edit" in the
right-click menu of an item in the Lookmark Toolbar. From the lookmark
inspector, the user can apply the lookmark in the active view or delete it
entirely by using the buttons at the top. The Pipeline View portion of the
lookmark inspector displays the filters that will be created when the lookmark 
is applied. The name and description of a lookmark can be edited, but the 
"Save" button must be pressed for these changes to take effect. The user also 
has control over two properties of how lookmark behave when they are applied. 
When a lookmark is created, the time value and camera properties in the 
selected view are stored in the lookmark. When the lookmark is applied, these 
saved values (time value and/or camera properties) can be restored. This 
behavior is controlled by two checkboxes at the bottom of the Lookmark 
Inspector. By default, neither of these values are applied with the lookmark. 
If the user marks or unmarks one of these checkboxes, then the Save button must 
be pressed for the changes to take effect next time the lookmark is applied.

<h2>Applying a Lookmark</h2>
<p>
This can be done from either the lookmark toolbar, inspector, or browser as 
described above. Like a filter, a lookmark requires input(s) and thus must be 
applied to one or more existing sources, depending on how many non-filter 
sources exist in the pipeline that has been stored in the lookmark. So how are 
its inputs determined? In the case of a lookmark with a single input, the 
source that is selected in the Pipeline Browser at the time the lookmark is 
applied is the input to the lookmark. If nothing is selected, the user is 
prompted to select the source from the pipeline to which the lookmark will be 
applied. If the lookmark contains two or more inputs, the user will be prompted 
automatically to specify which existing source to use for which input to the 
lookmark. The input to a lookmark can be either a reader, a source (i.e. an 
item from the Source menu), or a filter. Once the input is determined, the 
state of the lookmark's pipeline (which includes the pipeline filters, their 
display properties, and underlying properties of how ParaView is handling 
rendering) is simply loaded into the selected view. The parameters and display
properties of the input(s) to the lookmark remain unmodified with one
exception: point and cell arrays (attributes) that were turned on in the
reader from which the lookmark was created are turned on in the reader of the
pipeline to which it is applied. Lookmarks are applied to the selected view;
thus the visibility of the sources they generate are off in all other
existing views.
