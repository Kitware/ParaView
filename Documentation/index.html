<p>
ParaView 3.0 is a scalable, open-source visualization application. The
application runs on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from a
single-processor desktop machine to multi-processor shared-memory
supercomputers or clusters of computers. When run in a parallel environment,
ParaView can process very large data in a wide variety of data formats
(structured and unstructured, time varying and static).

<p>
ParaView provides a comprehensive suite of visualization algorithms and
supports many different file formats for both loading and exporting
datasets. This application is extensible, so new algorithms can be easily
added. ParaView 3.0 is more quantitative and data-centric than previous
versions of ParaView, providing more plotting and charting functionality as
well as allowing easier access to the data values underlying the
visualization.
