ParaView supports three different types of views (i.e., rendering
windows). It also allows multiple views, regardless of type, to be open at
the same time in a ParaView application window. When the application
launches, ParaView contains a single view: a 3D View. This is the type of
view that displays the geometry of datasets that have been loaded or created.

<p>
The two other types of views are the Bar Chart view and the XY Plot view. The
Bar Chart view can display a histogram of data values contained in a
dataset. The XY Plot view can display a 2D plot of one or more scalar
variables, either within a given dataset or across timesteps of a dataset
containing time information.

<p>
If the bar just above a view is right-clicked, a menu appears; it contains a
"Convert To" submenu that allows the type of a particular 3D view to be
changed to one of the other two types. Additionally, from this menu you may
close the view or split it horizontally or vertically. When a view is split,
creating a new view, the new view initially contains the buttons shown above
for selecting the view type.

<p>
In the upper right corner just above each view is a set of buttons specific to each view. A description of each button is given below.<br>

<table class="PropertiesTable" border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td><img src="LookmarkButton.png"></td><td>Create a lookmark for the contents of this view.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="SplitViewHorizontalButton.png"></td><td>Split this view into two views that are side-by-side horizontally.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="SplitViewVerticalButton.png"></td><td>Split this view into two views that are side-by-side vertically.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="MaximizeViewButton.png"</td><td>Maximize this view so it uses all the space in the ParaView application window available to views.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="RestoreViewButton.png"></td><td>This button becomes visible when the maximize button for a view has been pressed. It restores the view to its size before being maximized and re-displays the other views that were visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="CloseViewButton.png"></td><td>Close the associated view so it is no longer visible.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The position of views within the ParaView application window can be
interactively rearranged. Left-click in the bar above a view and drag it to
the bar above another view. The two views will swap places with one
another. Note that the view layout in the ParaView application window does
not change. (For example, the right-hand image below is the result of
swapping the position of the view at the top with the view in the lower
left in the left-hand image below.)
