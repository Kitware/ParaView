        <p>
          ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform application for the
          visualization and analysis of scientific datasets, primarily those
          that are defined natively in a two- or three-dimensional space
          including those that extend into the temporal dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front end graphical user interface (GUI) has an open, flexible and
          intuitive user interface that still gives you fine grained and open
          ended control of the data manipulation and display processing needed
          to explore and present complex data as you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          ParaView has extensive scripting and batch processing capabilities.
          The standard scripting interface uses the widely used python
          programming language for scripted control. As with the GUI, the python
          scripted control is easy to learn, including the ability to record
          actions in the GUI and save them out as succinct human readable python
          programs. It is also powerful, with the ability to write scripted
          filters that run on the server that have access to every bit of your
          data on a large parallel machine.

          ParaView's data
          processing and rendering components are built upon a modular and
          scalable distributed-memory parallel architecture in which many
          processors operate synchronously on different portions of the data.
          ParaView's scalable architecture allows you to run ParaView
          directly on anything from a small netbook class machine up to the
          world's largest supercomputer. However, the size of the datasets ParaView can
          handle in practice though varies widely depending on the size of
          the machine that ParaView's server components are run on. Thus people
          frequently do both, taking advantage of ParaView's client/server
          architecture to connect to and control the supercomputer from the
          netbook.
        </p>
        <p>
          ParaView is meant to
          be easily extended and customized into new applications and be used
          by or make use of other tools. Correspondingly there are a number
          of different interfaces to ParaView's data processing and
          visualization engine, for example the web based
          <a HREF="http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb">ParaViewWeb</a>.
          This book does not focus on these nor does it describe
          in great detail the programmers interface to the ParaView engine.
          The book instead focusus on understanding the standard
          ParaView GUI based application.

          The different sections of ParaView's Graphical User Interface (GUI) are shown
          below. Of particular importance in the following discussion are the:
          <ul>
            <li>File and Filter menus which allow you to open files and manipulate data</li>
            <li>Pipeline Browser which displays the visualization pipeline</li>
            <li>Object Inspector with its Properties, Display and Information
            tabs where you can control any given module within the
            pipeline</li>
            <li>View area where data is displayed in one or more windows.</li>

        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          One very important thing to keep in mind when using ParaView is that
          the GUI is very modal. At any given time you will have one
          &quot;active&quot; module within the visualization pipeline, one
          &quot;active&quot; view, and one &quot;active&quot; selection. For
          example when you click on the name of a reader or source within the
          Pipeline Browser, it becomes the active module and the properties of
          that filter are displayed in the Object Inspector. Likewise when you
          click within a different view, that view becomes the active view and
          the visibility &quot;eye&quot; icons in the Pipeline Browser are
          changed to show what filters are displayed within this View.  These
          concepts will be described in detail in later chapters.  For now you
          should be aware that the information displayed in the GUI always
          pertains to these active entities.

				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Basics Of Visualization</a></h2>
        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          Put simply, the process of visualization is taking raw data and
          converting it to a form that is viewable and understandable to humans.
          This enables a better cognitive understanding of our data. Scientific
          visualization is specifically concerned with the type of data that has
          a well-defined representation in 2D or 3D space. Data that comes from
          simulation meshes and scanner data is well suited for this type of
          analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three basic steps to visualizing your data: reading,
          filtering, and rendering. First, your data must be read into ParaView.
          Next, you may apply any number of filters that process the data to
          generate, extract, or derive features from the data. Finally, a
          viewable image is rendered from the data and you can then change the
          viewing parameters or rendering modality for best visual effect.
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="post">
				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">The Pipeline Concept</a></h2>
        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          In ParaView, these steps are made manifest in a visualization
          pipeline. That is you visualize data by building up a set of modules,
          each of which takes in some data, operates on it, and presents the
          result as a new dataset. This begins with a reader module that ingests
          data off of files on disk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading data into ParaView is often as simple as selecting Open from
          the File menu, and then clicking the glowing Accept button on the
          reader's Object Inspector tab. ParaView comes with support for a large
          number of file formats, and its modular architecture makes it possible
          to add new file readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a file is read, ParaView automatically renders it in a view. In
          ParaView, a view is simply a window that shows data. There are
          different types of views, ranging from qualitative computer graphics
          rendering of the data to quantitative spreadsheet presentations of the
          data values as text. ParaView picks a suitable view type for your data
          automatically, but you are free to change the view type, modify the
          rendering parameters of the data in the view, and even create new
          views simultaneously as you see fit to better understand what you have
          read in. Additionally, high level meta information about the data
          including names, types and ranges of arrays, temporal ranges, memory
          size and geometric extent can be found in the Information tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can learn a great deal about a given dataset with a one element
          visualization pipeline consisting of just a reader module. You can
          learn much more, and in fact perform arbitrarily complex analyses and
          data manipulations, adding modules to build up the pipeline. In
          ParaView you can create arbitrarily complex visualization pipelines,
          including ones with multiple readers, merging and branching pipelines.
          You build up a pipeline by choosing the next filter in the sequence
          from the Filters menu. Once you click accept, this new filter will
          read in the data produced by the formerly active filter and perform
          some processing on that data. The new filter then becomes the active
          one. Filters then are created differently from but operate in the same
          manner as readers. At all points you use the Pipeline Inspector to
          choose the active filter and then the Object Inspector to configure
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Pipeline Browser is where the overall Visualization Pipeline is
          displayed and controlled from. The Object Inspector is where the
          specific parameters of one particular module within the pipeline are
          displayed and controlled from. The Object Inspector has three tabs,
          one presents the parameters of the processing done within that module,
          another presents the parameters of how the output of that module will
          be displayed in a view, and the last presents the meta information
          about the data produced by the module as described above.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figure 1.2 demonstrates a three element visualization pipeline, where
          the output of each module in the pipeline is displayed in its own
          view. A reader takes in a vector field, defined on a curvilinear grid,
          which comes from a simulation study of a wind turbine. Next a slice
          filter produces slices of the field on five equally spaced planes
          along the X axis. Finally a warp filter warps those planes along the
          direction of the vector field, which primarily moves the planes
          downwind but also shows some complexity at the location of the wind
          turbine.

        <p>
          There are more than one hundred filters available to choose from, all
          of which manipulate the data in different ways. The full list of
          filters is available in the Appendix and within the application under
          the Help menu. Note that many of the filters in the menu will be
          grayed out and not selectable at any given time. That is because any
          given filter may only operate on particular types of data. For example
          the Extract Subset filter will only operate on structured data sets so
          it is only enabled when the module you are building on top of produces
          image data, rectilinear grid data, or structured grid data. (These
            input restrictions are also listed in the Appendix and help menu).
          In this situation you can often find a similar filter which does
          accept your data, or apply a filter which transforms your data into
          the required format. In ParaView 3.10 you can ask ParaView to try to
          do the conversion for you automatically, by clicking "Auto convert
          properties" in the application settings. The mechanics of applying
          filters are described fully in the Manipulating Data chapter.

      <div class="post">
				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Making Mistakes</a></h2>
        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          Frequently, new users of ParaView falter when they open their data, or
          apply a filter, and do not see it immediately because they have not
          pressed the Apply button. ParaView was designed to operate on large
          datasets, for which any given operation could take a long time to
          finish. In this situation you need the Apply button so that you have a
          chance to be confident of your change before it takes effect. The
          highlighted Apply button is a reminder that the parameters of one or
          more filters are out of sync with the data that you are viewing.
          Hitting the Apply button accepts your change (or changes) whereas
          hitting the Reset button reverts the options back to the last time you
          hit Apply. If you are working with small datasets, you may want to
          turn off this behavior with the Auto Accept setting under the
          Application Settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apply behavior circumvents a great number of mistakes but not all
          of them. If you make some change to a filter or to the pipeline itself
          and later find that you are not satisfied with the result, hit the
          Undo button. You can undo all the way back to the start of your
          ParaView session and redo all the way forward if you like. You can
          also undo and redo camera motion by using the camera undo and redo
          buttons located above each view window.
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="post">
				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Persistent Sessions</a></h2>
        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          If on the other hand you are satisfied with your visualization
          results, you may want to save your work so that you can return to it
          at some future time. You can do so by using ParaView's Save State
          ("File"|Save State) and Save Trace ("Tools"|Save Trace) features. In
          either case, ParaView produces human readable text files (XML files
            for State and Python script for Trace) that can be restored or
          modified and restored later. This is very useful for batch processing,
          which is discussed in the Python Scripting chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          To save state means to save enough information about the ParaView
          session to restore it later and thus show exactly the same result.
          ParaView does so by saving the current visualization pipeline and
          parameters of the filters within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you turn on a trace recording when you first start using ParaView,
          saving a trace can be used for the same purpose as saving state.
          However, a trace records all of your actions, including the ones that
          you later undo, as you do them. It is a more exact recording of not
          only what you did, but how you did it. Traces are saved as python
          scripts, which ParaView can play back in either batch mode or within
          an interactive GUI session. You can therefore use traces then to
          automate repetitive tasks by recording just that action. It is also an
          ideal tool to learn ParaView's python scripting API.
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="post">
				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Client/Server Visualization</a></h2>
        <div class="entry">
        <p>
          With small datasets it is usually sufficient to run ParaView as a
          single process on a small laptop or desktop class machine. For large
          datasets, a single machine is not likely to have enough processing
          power and much more importantly memory to process the data. In this
          situation you run an MPI parallel ParaView Server process on a large
          machine to do computationally and memory expensive data processing
          and/or rendering tasks and then connect to that server within the
          familiar GUI application.
        </p>
        <p>
          When connected to a remote server the only difference you will see
          will be that the visualization pipeline displayed in the Pipeline
          Browser will begin with the name of the server you are connected to
          rather than the word 'builtin' which indicates that you are connected
          to a virtual server residing in the same process as the GUI. When
          connected to a remote server, the File Open dialog presents the list
          of files that live on the remote machine's file system rather than the
          client's. Depending on the server's capabilities, the data size and
          your application settings ("Edit"|Settings|Render View|Server) the
          data will either be rendered remotely and pixels will be sent to the
          client or the geometry will be delivered and rendered locally. Large
          data visualization is described fully in the Client Server
          Visualization Chapter.
