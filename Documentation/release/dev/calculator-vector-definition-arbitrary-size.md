## Calculator: Enable vector definition of arbitrary size

`Calculator` now supports user-defined vectors of arbitrary size using the `{x, y, z, ...}` syntax and **NOTHING
ELSE** before or after it. The number of elements inside the braces determines the number of components in the resulting
array.

Additionally, the `pi` and `inf` constants are now added.

Finally, all calculator buttons now have a tooltip.
