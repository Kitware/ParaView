# Panoramic projection plugin

Add a new plugin that enables a new render view type called `panoramic projection`.
This new render view projects the current scene in order to capture the scene up to 360 degrees.
Produced images can be used as input for specific devices
like VR headsets, domes or panoramic screens.
Two projection types are available:

* Equirectangular projection (usual world map projection)
* Azimuthal equidistant projection (fisheye projection)
