## Save Screenshot: Organize Metadata

Previously, `Embed ParaView State` was part of the `Save Screenshot` proxy. Now it has been moved to the
`PNG` animation writer proxy and it has been grouped under a new property group `Metadata` along with `PNG`'s `MetaData`
property which has key-value pairs for storing additional information in the PNG files.
