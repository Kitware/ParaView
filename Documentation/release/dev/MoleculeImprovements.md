# Improvements to Graph and Molecules support

We introduced the following features:
 * Panel information handles values for graphs and molecules
 * Calculator supports graphs and molecules as input
 * Molecule representation supports 'map scalars' option: as for other datasets,
   it allows to disable the color mapping and then use direct RGB values from 3-components array.
