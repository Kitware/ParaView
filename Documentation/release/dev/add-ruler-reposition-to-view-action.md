## Add "Reposition to view" action for the **Ruler** source

The **Ruler** source UI has been improved:
- Control buttons are now at the top of the Ruler properties.
- A new button _Reposition to View_ is now available. You can now move the Ruler towards the camera view automatically by clicking on this button.
