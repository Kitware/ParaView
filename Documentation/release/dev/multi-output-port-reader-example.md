## MultiOutputPortReader example plugin

  A new example plugin (`Examples/Plugins/MultiOutputPortReader`) demonstrates
  how to create a reader with multiple output ports that supports file series
  via `vtkFileSeriesReader`. This serves as a reference for plugin developers
  who need time series support with multi-output-port readers.
