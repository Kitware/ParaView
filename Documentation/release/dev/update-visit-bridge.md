## Update the VisIt bridge readers

The VisIt bridge now uses readers from a recent release of VisIt (3.4.2). It had
previously been several years since ParaView was updated with the latest reader
code from VisIt. This update captures any bug fixes as well as consolidating any
build changes imported from the external repo.
