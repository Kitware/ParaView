# Adding a Logo Source
A new Logo source has been added. The source enables a user to show
a 2D RGBA image projected on the foreground of the rendering plane.
Its size, position and opacity can be changed interactively.

It will enable users to display the logo of their company or laboratory
on the images and videos generated with ParaView.
