## Setup an icon for macro

ParaView allows now to setup an icon for the python macros. You only need
to provide a `.svg` or a `.png` file with the same name than the macro.
This icon file should be manually added inside the ParaView configuration
`Macros` directory and then will be loaded along to the macro.
Removing the macro also delete the icon file.
