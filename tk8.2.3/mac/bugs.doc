We are now very close to passing the test suite for Tk.  We are very
interested in finding remaining bugs that still linger.  Please let us
know (and send us test cases) of any bugs you find.

Known bugs:

* Transient windows (set by wm transient) do not go away when the
  master does.

* Tearoff menus should be floating windows & floating windows should
  float.  They also shouldn't be resizable.

* The -use and -container windows only work with other Tk windows in
  the same process.  Also, if you try really hard (for instance by binding 
  on Destroy of an embedded window and destroying the container's toplevel) 
  you can get Tk to crash.  This should never be necessary, however, since
  the destruction of the embedded window triggers the destruction of the
  container, so you can watch that instead.
  All the focus bugs in Tk8.0 have been fixed, however.
  
* The send command is only implemented within the same app.

* You cannot color buttons, and the indicators for radiobuttons and
  checkbuttons under Appearance.  They will always use the current
  Theme color.  But, then, you are not supposed to...

* Drawing is not really correct.  This shows up mostly in the canvas
  when line widths are greater than one.  Unfortunantly, this will not
  be easy to fix.
  
* The active menu highlight color in Tearoff menus will not match the system-wide
  menu highlight color under Appearance.  It will be black instead.  This is not
  easy to fix, since the Appearance API's don't really allow you to get your hands
  on this information...

There are many other bugs.  However, will no get listed until they
are reported at least once.  Send those bug reports in!
