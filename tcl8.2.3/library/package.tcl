# pkg_compareExtension --
#
#  Used internally by pkg_mkIndex to compare the extension of a file to
#  a given extension. On Windows, it uses a case-insensitive comparison
#  because the file system can be file insensitive.
#
# Arguments:
#  fileName	name of a file whose extension is compared
#  ext		(optional) The extension to compare against; you must
#		provide the starting dot.
#		Defaults to [info sharedlibextension]
#
# Results:
#  Returns 1 if the extension matches, 0 otherwise

# pkg_mkIndex --
# This procedure creates a package index in a given directory.  The
# package index consists of a "pkgIndex.tcl" file whose contents are
# a Tcl script that sets up package information with "package require"
# commands.  The commands describe all of the packages defined by the
# files given as arguments.
#
# Arguments:
# -direct		(optional) If this flag is present, the generated
#			code in pkgMkIndex.tcl will cause the package to be
#			loaded when "package require" is executed, rather
#			than lazily when the first reference to an exported
#			procedure in the package is made.
# -verbose		(optional) Verbose output; the name of each file that
#			was successfully rocessed is printed out. Additionally,
#			if processing of a file failed a message is printed.
# -load pat		(optional) Preload any packages whose names match
#			the pattern.  Used to handle DLLs that depend on
#			other packages during their Init procedure.
# dir -			Name of the directory in which to create the index.
# args -		Any number of additional arguments, each giving
#			a glob pattern that matches the names of one or
#			more shared libraries or Tcl script files in
#			dir.

# the commands are used.
#
# Arguments:
# dir -			Directory containing all the files for this package.
# pkg -			Name of the package (no version number).
# version -		Version number for the package, such as 2.1.3.
# files -		List of files that constitute the package.  Each
#			element is a sub-list with three elements.  The first
#			is the name of a file relative to $dir, the second is
#			"load" or "source", indicating whether the file is a
#			loadable binary or a script to source, and the third
#			is a list of commands defined by this file.
