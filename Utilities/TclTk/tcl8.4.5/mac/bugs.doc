Known bug list for Tcl 8.0 for Macintosh

This was a new feature as of Tcl7.6b1 and as such I'll started with
a clean slate.  I currently know of no reproducable bugs.  I often
get vague reports - but nothing I've been able to confirm.  Let
me know what bugs you find!

The Macintosh version of Tcl passes most all tests in the Tcl
test suite.  Slower Macs may fail some tests in event.test whose
timing constraints are too tight.  If other tests fail please report
them.

Known bugs in the current release.

* With the socket code you can't use the "localhost" host name.  This
  is actually a known bug in Apple's MacTcp stack.  However, you can
  use [info hostname] whereever you would have used "localhost" to 
  achive the same effect.

* Most socket bugs have been fixed.  We do have a couple of test cases
  that will hang the Mac, however, and we are still working on them.
  If you find additional test cases that show crashes please let us
  know!

* In Tcl 8.2, the new Regexp code seems to be more deeply recursive than
the older version in Tcl8.0.  As a result, I have had to increase the Stack
size of Tcl to 1Meg.  If you are not doing regexps with many subexpressions,
this is probably more stack than you will need.  You can relink with the 
stack set to 512K, and you will be fine for most purposes.
* This regexp problem is fixed in Tcl8.3.  If you are going to do complex
regexp's, it is probably a good idea to keep the stack size big.  But normal
regexps will not cause crashes.

* The "clock scan -base" command does not work.  The epoch is wrong.
* The file mtime command does not work when setting the time, it is off
by 4 years.
