/**
* pqObjectBuilder is loosely based on the \c Builder design pattern.
* It is used to create as well as destroy complex objects such as
* views, displays, sources etc. Since most of the public API is
* virtual, it is possible for custom applications to subclass
* pqObjectBuilder to provide their own implementation for creation/
* destroying these objects. The application layer accesses the
* ObjectBuilder through the pqApplicationCore singleton.
* NOTE: pqObjectBuilder replaces the previously supported
* pqPipelineBuilder. Unlink, pqPipelineBuilder, this class
* no longer deals with undo/redo stack. The application layer
* components that use the ObjectBuilder are supposed to bother
* about the undo stack i.e. call begin/end on the undo stack
* before/after calling creation/destruction method on the ObjectBuilder.
